# used_cars_new
This project was created as a practice on creative web services. It will be deployed with the use of Render.
It was built using streamlit and it shows different plots analysing the information available on a dataset of used cars advertisements ranging from May 2018 - April 2019.
The final plots are interactive.

In order to launch this project on a local machine, please clone it and run it on the command line using streamlit run.
